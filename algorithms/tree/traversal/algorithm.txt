Algorithm breadthfirst(T):
    Initialize queue Q to contain T.root()
    while Q not empty do
        p = Q.dequeue()
        perform the "visit" action for position p
        for each child c in T.children(p) do 
            Q.enqueue(c)

for binary trees use the "inorder" traversal
example of usage is ordered binary search trees

Algorithm inorder(p):
    if p has a left child lc then
        inorder(lc)
    perform "visit" action on p
    if p has a right child rc then
        inorder(rc)
    perform "visit" action on p
